# pico8-maze
A PICO-8 game that implements some of the maze algorithms described in the really cool [Mazes for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/book/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers) book by Jamis Buck. Select a maze type and complete as many as you can before the time runs out. Bonus points for only following the single correct path to the goal.
